# Raneto

Raneto is an open-source Knowledgebase platform that uses static Markdown files to power your Knowledgebase. It can be called a "static site generator" of sorts as it doesn't require a database. All of your content is stored in the content folder in Markdown () files and the entire knowledgebase structure and content is generated by Raneto.
